			<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<p>If what you're testing has just a little conductivity, you can turn it into a key with the MaKey MaKey. Imagine a circuit (circle) going from the MaKey MaKey, up the earth cable (in your hand) and through you, and then through the item you're touching, back to the MaKey MaKey board. That circuit sends a signal - and your computer can't tell the difference between a signal coming from the MaKey MaKey and a signal coming from an actual keyboard. Why not try ketchup, cheese, paint, or play-doh? Even people are conductive! Connect one person to ground, and another to an input, and you can trigger sounds when they high-five.</p>
