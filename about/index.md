			<p>DigiCrafters is a series of learning, discovery and making projects, designed to introduce young people to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing">physical computing</a>. 
				The projects aim to give kids a fun, easy and creative way to discover <strong>sensors, microprocessors and circuits</strong>.</p>
			<h4>Why did we make this?</h4>
			<p>DigiCrafters started out as a series of exploratory workshops with the students at the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, UK. Each project was inspired by the curiosity and enthusiasm of the group we worked with.</p>
			<h4>Who are we?</h4>
			<p>We are Alex, Andy and Marie: three banana-wielding, egg-smashing MSc students. We're currently studying human-computer interaction at the University of Sussex and we built DigiCrafters for a module called Technology-Enhanced Learning Environments, taught by <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/judithg/About_Me.html" target="_blank">Dr. Judith Good</a>.</p>
